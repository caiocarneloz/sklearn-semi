# sklearn-semi
This code was developed as a part of my [Medium Story](https://medium.com/@caiocarneloz/a-simple-introduction-to-semi-supervised-learning-e20b2fe29ca0) about semi-supervised learning concepts and usage with scikit-learn.

## Getting Started
#### Dependencies
You need Python 3.5 or later to run **sklearn-semi**. You can find it at [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

You aso need numpy and sklearn packages, which is available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org). If you have pip, just run:
```
pip install numpy sklearn
```
